		<h3>Editing Storyboards</h3>
<p>Use drag &amp; drop to change the order of screens in a storyboard. Screens can also be rearranged using the <a href="ch08.html">Outline</a> view. You can also use drag &amp; drop to arrange screens in the screenflow view.</p>
<p>When working with storyboards you&#8217;ll often need to create slight variations of the same screen. <a href="ch31.html">Components</a> let you easily achieve this without unnecessary content duplication. Right click on a screen in the storyboard and choose <strong>Clone Screen&#8230;</strong>. In the opened wizard you are given the option to use a <a href="ch31.html">component</a> instead of copying the contents of the cloned screen. This option allows to quickly create derived screens that are automatically updated when the original screen changes. You can also choose to create a simple copy.</p>
<p>You can easily rename screens and storyboards directly from the <a href="ch04.html">Storyboard Editor</a>. Right click on the object you wish to rename and choose <strong>Rename</strong>.</p>
